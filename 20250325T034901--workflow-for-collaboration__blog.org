Collaboration is not a simple process. It’s certainly not always natural, but
over time, through working with different kinds of people, it becomes more
intuitive.

This write-up briefly describes how I choose to collaborate with others.

My process is by no means the best—it’s simply what works for me. At the end of
the day, if you have a process that yields good results, you shouldn't feel
pressured to change it.

Collaboration is essentially about communicating your thoughts in a clear and
concise manner while leaving room for modification based on others’ input.

* How should you start communicating?

To initiate a discussion with someone, you first need to establish context. The
context should be comprehensive enough for a reasonable newcomer to understand.

The best way to create this context is through a text document, as it allows
collaborators to read and revisit the information at their own pace. Most
importantly, it’s convenient. Writing and sharing a text document is relatively
simple compared to other methods. Additionally, a well-prepared document
encourages asynchronous work.

The next step is discussion based on the shared context. This discussion will
bring new insights, making some of the original context outdated while
introducing new ideas that should be incorporated. You should update the
document accordingly, preserving all relevant information. Any changes resulting
from the discussion should be tracked, and a history of these modifications
should be maintained.

The final step is to define a clear set of tasks that will conclude the context
and discussion.

* The Most Important Step: Discipline

There’s one more step that must be present throughout the entire process:
discipline. It’s easy to get ahead of ourselves and resort to quick, half-baked
communication for immediate responses. However, that approach is rarely
effective. Developing discipline in collaboration takes time, just like any
other habit.

* Tools

I’ve grown fond of Notion because it offers many of the features I need. Most
importantly, it makes editing text and discussing specific parts of a document
convenient.

I also want to experiment with using a GitHub repository for storing documents
and enabling discussions through comments on specific commits. I’ll share my
thoughts on that workflow once I’ve had enough experience with it.
